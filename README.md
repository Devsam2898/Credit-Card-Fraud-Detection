# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The dataset used in this project contains a mixture of genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as either genuine or fraudulent based on their features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card transactions. It consists of the following columns:

- Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- V1-V28: Principal components obtained through dimensionality reduction techniques for privacy reasons. These features are numeric and have been transformed.
- Amount: The transaction amount.
- Class: The target variable indicating whether the transaction is genuine (Class 0) or fraudulent (Class 1).

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:

- pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library used for loading, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.
- numpy: A library for efficient numerical computations in Python. It provides support for working with arrays and mathematical functions.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library that offers various algorithms and tools for classification, regression, and other tasks. It was used to train and evaluate the fraud detection model.
- matplotlib: A popular plotting library used for creating visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and line plots.
- seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating more appealing and informative visualizations.
- imbalanced-learn: A library specifically designed for handling imbalanced datasets. It provides various techniques for oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, and generating synthetic samples.
- joblib: A library used for saving and loading machine learning models. It allows us to persist the trained model for future use.

## Project Structure

The project directory consists of the following files:

- `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv`: The dataset file containing credit card transaction data used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the project, dataset, libraries used, and project structure.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries listed in the "Libraries Used" section using the `pip install` command.
2. Download the `credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv` file and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open the `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible Python development environment.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook in sequential order to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
5. Explore the results, including performance metrics, visualizations, and any additional analysis provided in the notebook.

Please note that you may need to adjust the file paths or make modifications to the code depending on your specific setup and requirements.

Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, techniques, or feature engineering approaches to improve the fraud detection model.

## Conclusion

The credit card fraud detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging the dataset and utilizing various libraries, we implemented data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to build an effective fraud detection solution.
